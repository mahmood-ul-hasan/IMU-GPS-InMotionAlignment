# GPS Aided In-Motion Coarse Alignment

## Description
This repository contains the code implementation of the paper titled "GPS Aided In Motion Coarse Alignment using Fast Optimal Attitude Matrix (FOAM) and Wavelet Filter" by M. u. Hassan, B. Qilian, N. Bessaad, and L. Liu, presented at the 2019 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC) in Hangzhou, China. [DOI: 10.1109/CAC48633.2019.8996886]

The repository is organized into several folders:

- **alignment_algorithm**: Contains the code for the alignment algorithm using Fast Optimal Attitude Matrix (FOAM) and Davenportâ€™s q-method.

- **IMU_and_GPS_dataset**: Contains sensor data that can be used to test the initial alignment process.

- **wavelet_filter_analysis**: Demonstrates the implementation of the wavelet filter on raw IMU data to filter noise.

- **results_comparison**: Compares the performance of different alignment methods.
